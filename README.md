# RBF
The specific requirement is unploaded in Question 3.

## Getting started
Carry out the design of RBF NN based on Gaussian kernel functions with constant spread function and using all the points in the training set as centers of the RB functions. Compare the performance results as varying the spread parameter while keeping it the same for all kernel functions.  
Perform the design of the RBF NN, using only 150 centers this time, choosing the ceters using two approaches: randomly select the centers from the input data and use k-means to find the centers.
